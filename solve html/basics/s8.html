Sublime Text 3 (ST3) is the latest version of one of the most commonly used plain text editors by web developers, coders, and programmers. It’s available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and free to download and use.

Make the most of ST3 with the 25 tips and tricks in this ultimate guide for web developers. Learn about must-have packages, useful keyboard shortcuts, and more.

1. User Preference Settings

By default, ST3 uses hard-tabs that are 4 characters long. This can result in hard-to-read code, as large tabular indents push your work to the right. I recommend all developers add this to their user settings (Sublime Text 3 => Preferences => Settings – User):

  {
    "draw_white_space": "all",
    "rulers": [80],
    "tab_size": 2,
    "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
  }
This setting converts hard-tabs to spaces, makes indents only two characters long, puts a ruler at the 80 character mark (to remind you to keep your code concise), and adds white space markers. Here is a complete list of preference options if you wish to continue customizing your ST3 environment.

		To view two column (vertical) panes side-by-side use the shortcut ALT-UP-2 (PC) or OPTION-⌘-2 (Mac). Replace the last stroke with “3” or “4” to view three or four panes respectively. Using “5” produces a 4 pane grid.

To view two row (horizontal) panes side-by-side use the shortcut SHIFT-ALT-UP-2 (PC) or SHIFT-OPTION-⌘-2 (Mac). Replace the last stroke with “3” to view three panes respectively.

2. Command Palette

ST3’s command palette will let you run toolbar actions (e.g. setting the code syntax for an opened file) without having to lift a finger from the keyboard. Although the command palette can be opened with a mouse through Tool => Command Palette, the best way to get the Command Palette prompt is to use the keyboard shortcut CTRL/⌘-SHIFT-P.

3. Column and Row Workspace Panes

Are you more a productive coder with multiple files open? ST3, like any good text editor, allows you to see files side by side, so that you won’t be switching back and forth between an HTML file and its CSS document:

Sublime Text 3 Layout

To view two column (vertical) panes side-by-side use the shortcut ALT-UP-2 (PC) or OPTION-⌘-2 (Mac). Replace the last stroke with “3” or “4” to view three or four panes respectively. Using “5” produces a 4 pane grid.

To view two row (horizontal) panes side-by-side use the shortcut SHIFT-ALT-UP-2 (PC) or SHIFT-OPTION-⌘-2 (Mac). Replace the last stroke with “3” to view three panes respectively.

Sublime column split into a group

If you want to split a pane further, you can use ST3’s “Group” feature. Use CTRL-K, SHIFT-CTRL-UP (PC) or ⌘-K, SHIFT-⌘-UP (Mac) to create a new group inside a pane.

4. Package Control

ST3 comes with a lot of features out of the box, but you can extend its functionality further with “packages”—plugins written by the greater ST3 community. The easiest way to install these packages is to use Package Control. To install Package Control on ST3, follow the installation instructions on Package Control’s website.
